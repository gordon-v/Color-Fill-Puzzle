# Color Fill Puzzle

A simple yet fun sliding puzzle game developed using Python's Pygame library. The goal of the game is to reach the end tile while avoiding obstacles, scoring points, and avoiding the "Game Over" state. The game incorporates a wrap-around board feature and various tile effects.



## Features

- **Dynamic Puzzle Board**: A 5x5 grid with tiles that have different effects:
  - **Green Tile**: Safe and does nothing.
  - **Blue Tile**: Awards 5 points when stepped on.
  - **Red Tile**: Ends the game immediately.
  - **Orange Tile**: Moves the player down.
  - **End Tile**: Reach this tile to win the game.
- **Wrap-Around Mechanism**: The player can move off one edge of the grid and reappear on the opposite edge.
- **Player Movement**: Move using the arrow keys or WASD keys.
- **Score Tracking**: Players can accumulate points by stepping on blue tiles.
- **Game Restart & Quit Options**: The game can be reset or quit using keyboard keys.
